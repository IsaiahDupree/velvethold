## Features

### Request Expiration Handling

Date requests automatically expire after 72 hours if not approved or declined. This ensures requests don't sit in limbo indefinitely.

**How it works:**
- When a date request is created, an `expiresAt` timestamp is set to 72 hours in the future
- A cron job runs hourly at `/api/cron/expire-requests` to automatically decline expired requests
- When requests expire, they are marked as declined and deposits are automatically refunded
- The approval API prevents approving expired requests

**Cron Job Setup:**
- The cron job is configured in `vercel.json` to run every hour
- For Vercel deployments, set the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
- The cron endpoint is secured with Bearer token authentication
- Manual trigger: `POST /api/cron/expire-requests` with `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`

## Development Progress

This project is being developed incrementally using autonomous coding agents. Progress is tracked in:

- **`feature_list.json`** - 65 features across 10 phases with completion status
- **`claude-progress.txt`** - Session-by-session development log
- **`prd.txt`** - Complete product requirements document

### Current Status: 12/65 features complete (18%)

**Phase 1 (Infrastructure):** ✅ Complete (12/12)
- Project setup, design system, database schema, basic UI pages

**Phase 2 (Auth):** 🔄 Next (0/6)
- Authentication, session management, protected routes

**Phases 3-10:** ⏳ Pending
- Profiles, Browse, Requests, Management, Chat, Verification, Safety, Polish

### For Autonomous Agents

When working on this project:

1. **Check Progress:** Read `claude-progress.txt` and `feature_list.json` first
2. **Pick Next Feature:** Focus on incomplete features in the current phase (prioritize P0 → P1 → P2)
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify the feature works before marking as complete
4. **Update Tracking:**
   - Update `feature_list.json` with `"passes": true` and `"completedAt": "YYYY-MM-DD"`
   - Append progress to `claude-progress.txt` with what was done
5. **Run Tests:** Use `npm run build` and `npm run lint` to catch errors

### Testing Features

To verify a feature is complete:
- UI features: Visual inspection + user flow testing
- API features: Test with curl/Postman or integration tests
- Database features: Check data persistence and relationships
- Build: Must pass `npm run build` without errors

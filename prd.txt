# VelvetHold - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
**Name:** VelvetHold (Numerology: 44 → 8 - Builder/Business/Systems Energy)

**Tagline:** Premium date reservation platform with deposit-based commitment

**Platform Strategy:** Web-first (avoids app store rejection risk), native apps later after validation

**Target Audience:** Women first (invitees), then expand to all genders

## Core Problem
Dating apps suffer from no-shows, low-effort requests, and safety concerns. VelvetHold solves this by requiring a refundable deposit for date requests, creating accountability and filtering for serious matches.

## Key Differentiators
- **Deposit-based requests** (not "paying for dates" - framed as reservation/no-show protection)
- **Approval gates** - invitees control who they meet
- **Availability visibility** - optional schedule sharing for paid requesters
- **Safety-first** - verified profiles, public meetup requirements, clear boundaries

## MVP Feature Set (v1)

### Core Flow: Request → Deposit → Approve/Decline

#### 1. Invitee Profile Setup
**Required:**
- Verified selfie + ID check (liveness detection)
- Age (18+ gating, DOB required)
- City/area (not exact address)
- Date preferences (coffee/dinner/activity/museum)
- About me / what I'm looking for
- Dealbreakers/boundaries (e.g., "public places only", "no late-night first meets")
- Screening prompts (3-5 questions):
  - "What's your idea of a good first date?"
  - "What are you looking for?"
  - "Why me?"
- Deposit amount + explicit purpose ("reservation hold", "no-show protection")
- Cancellation/no-show policy (clear, simple)

**Optional:**
- Availability windows (time blocks, not exact calendar)
- Request cap per week (spam prevention)
- Visibility settings (who can see availability)

#### 2. Requester Profile Setup
**Required:**
- Verified selfie + ID check (liveness detection)
- Age (18+ gating, DOB required)
- Basic bio + intent (dating/relationship/friends)
- Answers to screening prompts
- Preferred date type + general area
- "Why this date?" message

**Optional:**
- Employment/education (careful with discrimination)

#### 3. Request Flow
1. Requester browses invitee profiles
2. Selects availability window (if shown)
3. Answers screening questions
4. Writes intro message
5. Pays deposit (held in escrow)
6. Request sent to invitee

#### 4. Approval Flow
1. Invitee sees request + profile + answers
2. Approve or Decline
3. **If Declined:** deposit refunded immediately
4. **If Approved:** 
   - Chat unlocks
   - Date details finalized
   - Deposit held until date time
   - Deposit handling per policy (refunded if date happens, or per no-show rules)

### Availability System (Privacy-Preserving)

**Visibility Levels:**
- Public (not recommended)
- Verified users only
- Only users who paid deposit
- Only users I've approved (most private)

**Display Format:**
- Availability windows, NOT real calendar
- Examples: "Tue-Thu: 6-9pm", "Sat: 11am-3pm", "Next 7 days: 4 open slots"
- Fuzzing options: show "Evening" instead of "7:00pm"
- Buffer zones: 15-60 min buffer around slots

**What NOT to show:**
- Exact address
- Live location
- Google Calendar integration
- Precise "busy" blocks that reveal patterns

**Data Model:**
- `availability_rules` (weekly recurring rules)
- `availability_slots` (generated for next 14-30 days)
- `date_requests` (slot_id, requester_id, deposit_status, approval_status)
- `visibility_level` (enum)

### Payment System (Critical for Compliance)

**Framing:** Refundable deposit / reservation hold (NOT "paying for access to a person")

**Deposit Flow:**
1. Held in escrow when request submitted
2. Refunded if declined
3. If approved: held until date time
4. Released per policy:
   - Both confirm date happened → refunded
   - No-show → per cancellation policy
   - Dispute → manual review

**Safer Payment Structures:**
- Refundable deposit escrow
- Venue credit conversion option
- Mutual date wallet (tickets/food/transport only)
- Charity lockbox option (if no-show, goes to charity)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Chargeback handling
- Fraud detection
- Harassment/extortion prevention
- Clear dispute resolution
- Identity verification requirements

### Safety Features (Non-Negotiable)

**For Both Sides:**
- 18+ gating + DOB verification
- Selfie verification (liveness)
- Optional ID verification
- "Public meetups only" baseline (first few dates)
- Report/block system
- Moderation tools
- Clear boundaries/dealbreakers

**Privacy:**
- No exact addresses until approved
- No live location sharing
- Fuzzy time windows
- Request caps to prevent spam

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Matching
- "Priority requests" (limited slots, NOT "bidding" - too risky for stores)
- Multiple request handling (invitee sees all, picks best fit)
- Profile verification badges
- Date type filters

### Phase 3: Experience Improvements
- In-app chat (post-approval)
- Date confirmation/check-in
- Feedback/rating system (mutual, post-date)
- Venue suggestions
- Calendar integration (private)

### Phase 4: Native Apps

## Compliance & Legal

### App Store Considerations
- **Google Play:** High rejection risk if framed as "pay to date"
- **Apple App Store:** High rejection risk if "payment for access to person"
- **Solution:** Frame as "reservation deposit" / "no-show protection"
- **Avoid:** "Bidding", "auction", "pay me to date me" language

### Payment Processor Risk
- Stripe lists dating as higher-risk category
- Must have clear terms that money is NOT for "access to a person"
- Escrow/refundable structure is safer
- Clear dispute resolution required

### Safety & Moderation
- 18+ only (strict age verification)
- Public meetup requirements
- Report/block system
- Moderation team for disputes
- Clear terms of service
- Privacy policy (GDPR/CCPA compliant)

### Advertising Restrictions
- Google Ads may require dating certification
- Facebook/Instagram have dating ad restrictions
- Plan for organic/referral growth initially

## Success Metrics (v1)

### Acquisition
- Sign-ups per week
- Invitee vs requester ratio
- Verification completion rate

### Engagement
- Requests sent per week

### Revenue

### Safety

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Private Beta (Weeks 1-4)
- Invite-only (50 invitees, 200 requesters)
- Major cities only (NYC, LA, SF)
- Manual verification
- Direct feedback loops

### Phase 2: Public Beta (Weeks 5-12)
- Open sign-ups with waitlist
- Automated verification
- Referral system
- Content marketing (safety-focused)

### Phase 3: Scale (Week 13+)
- Paid acquisition (if economics work)
- Expand cities
- Native apps (if web validates)
- Partnership with venues

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Payment processor rejection → Have backup (Stripe + Braintree)
- Fraud/chargebacks → Strong verification + clear policies
- Scalability → Vercel + Supabase handle scale well

### Business Risks
- Low approval rates → Improve matching/screening
- High refund rates → Better cancellation policies
- Safety incidents → Strong moderation + public-only baseline

### Legal Risks
- App store rejection → Web-first strategy
- Payment processor issues → Clear "reservation" framing
- Liability → Strong ToS + insurance

## Open Questions
1. What happens if both parties no-show?
2. Should deposits be tiered (coffee vs dinner)?
3. How do we handle timezone differences?
4. Should we allow video verification calls pre-date?
5. What's the dispute resolution process?
6. Should we have a "date happened" confirmation from both sides?

## Next Steps

2. Set up Next.js project with shadcn/ui
3. Design database schema
4. Build authentication flow
